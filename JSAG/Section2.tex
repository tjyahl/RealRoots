\section{Elimination}
%regular reprersentation and Stickelberger's theorem?
%what we mean by elimination (minimal polynomial in Artinian ring)
%this is an univariate eliminant in the case ring element is variable
%rational univariate eliminant uses characteristic polynomial instead of minimal polynomial
%for zero-dimensional real systems, this gives an effective way to compute real solutions

{\color{red} Frank thinks we should do a Galois computation of 27 lines on a symmetric cubic surface.}
