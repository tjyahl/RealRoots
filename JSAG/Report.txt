Dear Professor Lopez Garcia,

Acting on expert advice, I am writing to ask you to revise and upload
a revision of the article

   Real solutions to systems of polynomial equations in Macaulay2
   by Jordy Lopez Garcia, Kelly Maluccio, Frank Sottile and Thomas Yahl

submitted to the Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry.

Referee reports may be attached to this letter, indicating the
necessary changes.

When finished, please upload the revision to

https://ef.msp.org/uploadrev.php?p_id=144987&cr=7E8BEC95EF

You will need to upload at the same time a PDF or text file with a
summary of changes and an explanation of departures, if any, from the
reviewer recommendations. 

Please do not reply to this message.  You can track the status of your
article and contact the journal or editors at

220819-Lopez-v1: technical review of the package "RealRoots" and its article,
by Lopez-Garcia, Maluccio, Sottile, and Yahl.

The package has 577 lines of code, 511 lines of documentation, and 189 lines
of tests.  The package can be installed without error, and the tests succeed.

comments on code:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
comments on documentation:

The name of the package contains the word "real", but the description of the
package doesn't contain the word "real" :

      The purpose of this package is to provide general tools for
      elimination and solving systems of polynomial equations.

Added "with the particular emphasis on real solutions"

In the documentation for "HurwitzMatrix", Insert a space before "of":

      submatrix $H_{k}$of the Hurwitz matrix

Added space.

In the documentation for "traceForm", it should be mentioned that g
and I should be in the same ring.

Added description.

Moreover, throughout the documentation, we edited:

Updated jsag.bib

Throughout the documentation, changed "a lower bound" (resp. "an upper bound") to "the left endpoint" (resp. "the right endpoint")

"rational univariate polynomial" to "polynomial with rational coefficients"

Line 636: Added that the ideal I lies in the polynomial ring containing g

Line 689: Added that the ideal I lies in the polynomial ring containing g

Line 725: Deleted extra "is" before f_k

Lines 749-752, 805: Replaced "on" by "in"

Line 823: Compactified writing to "We give examples with infinite intervals"

Line 837: Removed "ordered"

Line 855: Re-wrote Output description to "of disjoint intervals"

Line 856: Re-wrote description for realRootIsolation

Line 877-878: Added that added that the number of real roots is counted with multiplicity

Line 878-879: Simplified interval description in the second sentence, and added that ring f is allowed to be multivariate

Line 961-962: Removed "not counting multiplicity" and "without multiplicity" and added "after a base change to an algebraically-closed field"

Line 993: Added "(generators of a zero-dimensional ideal)"

Line 996: Removed redundant ", and where ", TT "S", " is an Artinian ring of characteristic 0.},"

Line 1048: Used latex on degree n

Line 1053-1054: Used latex on degree n. Added that ring f is allowed to be multivariate.

Line 1080-1083: Used latex on degree n. Added that ring f is allowed to be multivariate

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
comments on paper:

Instead saying just "c_i \in R is nonzero", say
"and for each i, c_i\in R is nonzero".

Added "each" in front of "$0\leq i \leq k$, $c_{i}\in\RR$ is nonzero."

"We have that" is a strange abuse of the English language, adopted by many
mathematicians to indicate that some is true.  It would sound better to say
"The inequality ... holds, ...".

Corrected

Moreover, we made the following changes:

Line 362: Added "real" before "root"

Line 410: Replaced "all the Hurwitz determinants $\Delta_{1},\dots,\Delta_{k}$ are positive." by "each Hurwitz determinant $\Delta_{1},\dots,\Delta_{k}$ is positive."

Line 446: Removed "new"

Line 490: Added "its" before signature

Line 493: Removed "$d\vcentcolon = \dim(R)$", as this was not used.
