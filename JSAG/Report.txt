Dear Professor Lopez Garcia,

Acting on expert advice, I am writing to ask you to revise and upload
a revision of the article

   Real solutions to systems of polynomial equations in Macaulay2
   by Jordy Lopez Garcia, Kelly Maluccio, Frank Sottile and Thomas Yahl

submitted to the Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry.

Referee reports may be attached to this letter, indicating the
necessary changes.

When finished, please upload the revision to

https://ef.msp.org/uploadrev.php?p_id=144987&cr=7E8BEC95EF

You will need to upload at the same time a PDF or text file with a
summary of changes and an explanation of departures, if any, from the
reviewer recommendations. 

Please do not reply to this message.  You can track the status of your
article and contact the journal or editors at

220819-Lopez-v1: technical review of the package "RealRoots" and its article,
by Lopez-Garcia, Maluccio, Sottile, and Yahl.

The package has 577 lines of code, 511 lines of documentation, and 189 lines
of tests.  The package can be installed without error, and the tests succeed.

comments on code:

comments on documentation:

The name of the package contains the word "real", but the description of the
package doesn't contain the word "real" :

      The purpose of this package is to provide general tools for
      elimination and solving systems of polynomial equations.

In the documentation for "HurwitzMatrix", Insert a space before "of":

      submatrix $H_{k}$of the Hurwitz matrix

In the documentation for "traceForm", it should be mentioned that g
and I should be in the same ring.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
comments on paper:

Instead saying just "c_i \in R is nonzero", say
"and for each i, c_i\in R is nonzero".

"We have that" is a strange abuse of the English language, adopted by many
mathematicians to indicate that some is true.  It would sound better to say
"The inequality ... holds, ...".
