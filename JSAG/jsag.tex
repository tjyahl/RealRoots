\begin{abstract}
 The \textit{Macaulay2} package \texttt{RealRoots} provides symbolic methods to study real solutions to systems of polynomial equations.
 It updates and expands an earlier package developed by Sottile and Grayson in 1999.
 We provide mathematical background and descriptions of the  \texttt{RealRoots} package, giving examples which illustrate some of its
 implemented methods.
 We also prove a general version of Sylvester's Theorem.

%historical background/motivation, discussion of prior results, contribution and why it's important/interesting/novel

Understanding the number of real solutions to systems of polynomials is fundamental for real algebraic geometry and for applications of
algebraic geometry.
In 1999, Grayson and Sottile \cite{So_M2} developed the \textit{Macaulay2} package \texttt{realroots} for this purpose.
That package had limited functionality and not all of its implemented methods remain compatible with modern releases of \textit{Macaulay2}.

The \textit{Macaulay2} package \texttt{RealRoots} expands and modernizes \texttt{realroots}, superseding it.
\texttt{RealRoots} implements symbolic methods for studying real solutions of polynomial systems.
This note provides some descriptions of the mathematical background and examples of methods from the package.
Its  three sections each describe related methods.

Section 1 describes methods for counting and isolating real roots of univariate polynomials, as well as methods for determining if a
polynomial is Hurwitz stable.
We could not find a proof of Sylvester's Theorem~\ref{Th:Sylvester} in complete generality in the literature, and have included a sketch for
completeness. 

Section 2 describes methods involving elimination that reduce a zero-dimensional system of multivariate polynomials to a univariate
polynomial for solving, studying the number of real solutions, or addressing other arithmetic questions, such as Galois groups.

Section 3 describes a further method for studying zero-dimensional systems, {\color{red}expand on this} based on the trace form.
