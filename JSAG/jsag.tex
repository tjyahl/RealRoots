\begin{abstract}
The Macualay2 package \texttt{RealRoots} contains methods for studying real roots of univariate polynomials and real solutions of multivariate systems as well as @@@@@. It updates and expands the capabilities of the package ``RealRoots'' given by @@@@@. For univariate polynomials, counting roots in intervals, isolating roots symbolically, and stability. For multivariate systems there are general methods of elimination for zero dimensional systems or univariate eliminant of zero-dimensional systems, this includes the rational univariate representative. For real multivariate, we have the trace form.

\section{Real Univariate Systems}
%Budan Fourier theorem (reference, vague statement)
\theorem[Budan-Fourier]{Let $f\in \mathbb{R}[t]$ be a univariate polynomial and $a<b$ two numbers in $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. Then $$\text{var}(\delta f,a) - \text{var}(\delta f,b) \geq r(f,a,b),$$ and the difference is even.}
%Sylvester's theorem (reference ?, nice picture, proof outline)
\theorem[Sylvester]{}

%Sturm's theorem
\theorem[Sturm]{Let $f$ be a univariate polynomial and $a,b\in \mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$ with $a<b$ and $f(a),f(b)\neq 0$. Then the number of zeroes of $f$ in the interval $(a,b]$ is the difference $$\text{var}(F,a) - \text{var}(F,b),$$ where $F$ is the Sturm sequence of $f$.}
%Real root isolation

%Hurwitz stability
\theorem{Let $f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n}a_{j}x^{j}$ with $n\geq 1$ and $a_{n}>0$. Then $f$ is Hurwitz stable if and only if all the Hurwitz determinants $\delta_{1},\dots,\delta_{n}$ are all positive.}

\section{Eliminations}
%regular reprersentation and Stickelberger's theorem?
%what we mean by elimination (minimal polynomial in Artinian ring)
%this is an univariate eliminant in the case ring element is variable
%rational univariate eliminant uses characteristic polynomial instead of minimal polynomial
%for zero-dimensional real systems, this gives an effective way to compute real solutions
