\begin{abstract}
The Macualay2 package \texttt{RealRoots} contains methods for studying real roots of univariate polynomials and real solutions of multivariate systems as well as @@@@@. It updates and expands the capabilities of the package ``RealRoots'' given by @@@@@. For univariate polynomials, counting roots in intervals, isolating roots symbolically, and stability. For multivariate systems there are general methods of elimination for zero dimensional systems or univariate eliminant of zero-dimensional systems, this includes the rational univariate representative. For real multivariate, we have the trace form.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Real Univariate Systems}
%Budan Fourier theorem (reference, vague statement)
%Sylvester's theorem (reference ?, nice picture, proof outline)
%Sturm's theorem
%Real root isolation
%Hurwitz stability
%
%M2 examples along the way
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Eliminations}
%regular reprersentation and Stickelberger's theorem?
%what we mean by elimination (minimal polynomial in Artinian ring)
%this is an univariate eliminant in the case ring element is variable
%rational univariate eliminant uses characteristic polynomial instead of minimal polynomial
%for zero-dimensional real systems, this gives an effective way to compute real solutions
