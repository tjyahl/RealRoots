* The file allSections.m2 is run to create the raw Macaulay2 output for the paper.
   You need to uncomment the line in your init.m2 file:

 if fileExists "start.m2" then load(currentDirectory()|"start.m2")

* I moved the unneeded files out of the examples/ directory

* I put the sections back into the jsag paper, moving SectionX.tex to Old/

* In the documentation:

  regularRepresentation -- the regular representation of an Artinian ring

  Maybe "the regular representation of an element of an Artinian ring" ?

  traceCount -- the number of points of the spectrum of an Artinian ring over any field, not counting multiplicity

  Strictly speaking, this is not quite correct, you mean the degree of the reduced scheme of an Artinian ring, but that may
  be confusing.   Note that this is finessed in Section 3

  traceForm -- the trace quadratic form of a polynomial in an Artinian ring

    "trace symmetric form"  (this is how it is in the paper.)

  in traceCount, what does it mean to run traceCount(f) when f is a polynomial?  I think that something is missing here,
    say a univariate polynomial ?

  The output is defined when the input is an Artinian ring, but what about the other inputs?

  The examples should illustrate traceCount with its different inputs.

   I think that someting is amiss here.  The headline description does not agree with the description at the foot of the
   page.  Maybe this routine should just be removed?  Maybe it is OK.

   Let uis finish the package when I get back.
