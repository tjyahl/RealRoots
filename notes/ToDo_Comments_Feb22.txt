Maybe need something for the trace form for real root location and counting numbers of real roots

ABOVE CODE CORRECTED, assert(HurwitzDeterminant(f,4)== -1876) and I accidentally had another number.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I ran:
installPackage("RealRoots", RemakeAllDocumentation => true, Verbose => false)

I got error messages, including

ABOVE CORRECTED

The following are not valid (at least from Germany)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MATH DEPT does not support those websites any more...suggestions: Kelly: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-maluccio-burke and Thomas: https://www.math.tamu.edu/directory/formalpg.php?user=thomasjyahl
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basic documentation (and name) suggests a limit to QQ[x], but some routines, such as eliminants, are just fine over
any field.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO BE CORRECTED...usually when we compute over RR, we obtain a warning "computation over inexact field"
It just means that our output may be a float...perhaps we should include more examples over RR either way
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for BudanFourierBound:
  Maybe 'sharp' can be removed, and it should be said that this computes the upper bound from the
    Budan-Fourier Theorem, with a mumble about difference being positive   
  The numbers a, b can also be infinity (as an example shows for b), but also negative infinity for a?
  Is the coefficient field QQ or RR or some totally real field?

In the code, it does not test that the input f is a univariate polynomial
Does f need to be univariate, or must it be a element in a ring with one variable.  (These are different?)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The polynomial must be univariate, and at the moment, 
it must also be an element in a ring with one variable, ex. x^2-1 in RR[x] works but not in RR[x,y]
I am working on this
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
charPoly(Matrix)
  What field/ring is the matrix over?
  The variable for the characteristic polynomial; is it specified by the user or not?  Can it be specified by the user?
  What ring is the characteristic polynomial in ?  Can it have an arbitrary field.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The variable is not specified by the user, it is Z. I need to check with Thomas...According to the M2 documentation for "ring -- get the associated ring of an object", ring(matrix) is associated to its natural base ring; however, I think we can modify it in such a way that it is over another field we 
Prefer (maybe using the command _ and choosing what ring we want). Since we set the symbol "Z" in the 
Code, I don't think we can change the variable for the characteristic polynomial. Similar to the change
Of base ring for our matrix, I think we can also change the base field of the characteristic polynomial 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
eliminant(RingElement)
  Does f need to be in an Artinian ring?   How is that specified?   This is particularly missing a lot.
  There are different usages that need to be specified in the documentation.
  Strategy is missing ?
  Also missing a discussion that there are different methods,...
  Can we eliminate w.r.t out choice of variables?  How about with respect to a linear form or some other polynomial?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to ask Thomas here
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HurwitzDeterminant(RingElement,Number)
  What if f is a univariate polynomial not over an ordered field ?
  Is the output necessarily a real number?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theorem 5.2.10 is for real univariate polynomials. Perhaps we can generalize... The output can be real yes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
isHurwitzStable(RingElement)
  This, like the last, should say something in the documentation about the input is a univariate polynomial
     (but not necessarily in a ring with one indeterminate).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORRECTED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Can we have a command for returning a Hurwitz matrix?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
numSturm(f,a,b)
  This is also missing documentation, such as the meaning of the multiplicity option, and perhaps other options.
  What is the coefficient field?  Do we check for it?  Why not?
  (Many routines are mission checks.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
numSylvester(RingElement,RingElement,Number,Number)
  This also has missing documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
numTrace(QuotientRing)
  This also has missing documentation.  How does it do it?
  What about the more sophisticated routines for quadratic trace form?
  Does it test that it is Artinian  and the field is RR or QQ (or do our routines only work over QQ), which is OK.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
realRootIsolation(RingElement,RR)
  How is can a list be "the number of real roots..."?
  We need to discuss what this does and what to do with it.
  What is the role of eps?  Is eps checked to be positive ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
regularRep(RingElement,Ideal)
  A little more documentation may be needed (linear map on what?)  Is this OK for any field?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SturmSequence(RingElement)
  What field is needed here ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
traceForm(RingElement)
 More documentation is needed, such as what is the ring?  Can it be an Artinian ring, or a polynomial ring plus a
 zero-dimensional ideal?

 Maybe we can have something to help determine zeroes in the positive orthant or.....

 There is some definition inconsistency in what types or rings hold our various elements, and etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
variations(List)
  What is the sequence of?  Do we test for that? ??
