Maybe need something for the trace form for real root location and counting numbers of real roots

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
charPoly(Matrix)
  What field/ring is the matrix over?
  Must work over an arbitrary field, as it is used in elimination.
  Field [ my Variable ]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
eliminant(RingElement)
  Does f need to be in an Artinian ring?   How is that specified?   This is particularly missing a lot.
  There are different usages that need to be specified in the documentation.
  Strategy is missing ?
  Also missing a discussion that there are different methods,...
  Can we eliminate w.r.t out choice of variables?  How about with respect to a linear form or some other polynomial?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to ask Thomas here
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HurwitzDeterminant(RingElement,Number)
  What if f is a univariate polynomial not over an ordered field ?
  Is the output necessarily a real number?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theorem 5.2.10 is for real univariate polynomials. Perhaps we can generalize... The output can be real yes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
numSturm(f,a,b)
  This is also missing documentation, such as the meaning of the multiplicity option, and perhaps other options.
  What is the coefficient field?  Do we check for it?  Why not?
  (Many routines are mission checks.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
numSylvester(RingElement,RingElement,Number,Number)
  This also has missing documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
numTrace(QuotientRing)
  This also has missing documentation.  How does it do it?
  What about the more sophisticated routines for quadratic trace form?
  Does it test that it is Artinian  and the field is RR or QQ (or do our routines only work over QQ), which is OK.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
realRootIsolation(RingElement,RR)
  How is can a list be "the number of real roots..."?
  We need to discuss what this does and what to do with it.
  What is the role of eps?  Is eps checked to be positive ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
regularRep(RingElement,Ideal)
  A little more documentation may be needed (linear map on what?)  Is this OK for any field?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SturmSequence(RingElement)
  What field is needed here ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
traceForm(RingElement)
 More documentation is needed, such as what is the ring?  Can it be an Artinian ring, or a polynomial ring plus a
 zero-dimensional ideal?

 Maybe we can have something to help determine zeroes in the positive orthant or.....

 There is some definition inconsistency in what types or rings hold our various elements, and etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
variations(List)
  What is the sequence of?  Do we test for that? ??
