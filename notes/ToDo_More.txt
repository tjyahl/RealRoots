Frank has some thoughts on final routines to add

*) Check if an ideal I of K[x_1,...,x_n] is zero-dimensional

*) Compute the number of complex roots of an ideal using the trace form
    (note deg I = this number ==> I is radical)

*) Compute the number of real roots of I using the trace form

*) Algorithmically compute a separating linear form -- this may need characteristic zero

    Input   (I,d) where d is the degree of the radical of I
                  (could also have an option where d is computed to be the degree of I, but then
		     we only compute an eliminant of degree d, if there is one)
		     
     Goal: compute an elininant f w.r.t. a linear form whose number of zeroes is d

       First: for each variable x
     *     compute eliminant f(x) if degree f is d, export f
     *       otherwise if degree f/(gcd(f,f')) = d, then export f
       If this fails, go to the next variable.

     Otherwise, for j = 1,2,....,d(d-1)/2, set
        l = x_1 + j x_2 + j^2 x_3 + ... + j^{n-1} x_n, and
	compute the eliminant with respect to l, and apply the previous steps *

   One of these forms (variables or the interesting linear forms) will take distinct values
     at the roots of I (and thus be separating)
