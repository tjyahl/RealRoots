Here are some capabilities that I'd like to have in the Macaulay2 real package

* There are several ways to compute eliminants.  Combine them into one method
   with different strategies.

  Thomas is working on this

* Include a check for the shape Lemma (make sure that it applies before applying it)
   and a fix to get it right (?)

* Sturm.  Should do this for real roots in an interval, as well as positive
           reals, negative reals, and all real.

* real root isolation using bisection method

* Implement Budan-Fourier   Jordy and Kelly

* Trace form, including the multivariate case.

* (?) Hurwicz stability or other stability

* Hermite-Biehler

* Routh-Hurwicz

* Hurwicz determinant

* Stickelberger's theorem, eigenvalues and solving

* Brainstorm about other capabilities.

* Some of these should work over fields/rings with arbitrary coefficients.

* Sturm-Habicht in place of Sturm for height complexity 

* Sylvester's Theorem Var(Syl(p,q),a,b) = 
                    #{x| p(x)=0 and q(x)>0} -   #{x| p(x)=0 and q(x)<0}
