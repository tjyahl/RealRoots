To Do
-----

* eliminants and strategies (which is default?)

* real root isolation using bisection method

* trace form check

* Hurwicz stability and/or other stability (Hermite-Biehler, Routh-Hurwicz, Hurwicz determinant)

* documentation

* email Dan Grayson about being named


----------
To Discuss
----------

* Sturm sequences & multiple roots

* include a check for the shape lemma

* Sturm-Habicht in place of Sturm for height complexity

* working over more interesting fields

* Stickelberger's theorem, eigenvalues and solving

* always print warnings? or give option?


---------
Completed
---------

* Implement Budan-Fourier

* Sylvester's Theorem Var(Syl(p,q),a,b) = 
                    #{x| p(x)=0 and q(x)>0} -   #{x| p(x)=0 and q(x)<0}
