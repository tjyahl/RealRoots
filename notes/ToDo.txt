Here are some capabilities that I'd like to have in the Macaulay2 real package

* There are several ways to compute eliminants.  Combine them into one method
   with different strategies.

* Include a check for the shape Lemma (make sure that it applies before applying it)
   and a fix to get it right (?)

* Sturm.  Should do this for real roots in an interval, as well as positive
           reals, negative reals, and all real.

* Implement Budan-Fourier

* Trace form, including the multivariate case.

* (?) Hurwicz stability or other stability

* Hermite-Biehler

* Routh-Hurwicz

* Hurwicz determinant

* Stickelberger's theorem, eigenvalues and solving

* Brainstorm about other capabilities.

* Some of these shold work over fields/rings with arbitrary coefficients.

* Sturm-Habicht in place of Sturm for height complexity
